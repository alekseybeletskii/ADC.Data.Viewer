SATURN SDI-AD12-128H, http://www.saturn-data.com&#10;&#10;Some interactive plotter settings and Savitsky-Golay filter are available&#10;You can view signals one by one as well&#10;&#10;ADC files examples are included in the &quot;resources/sampledata/&quot; subfolder.&#10;Check &quot;resources/jpg/&quot; sub-folder with screen-shots.&#10;Executable Jar file is located in &quot;resources/jar/&quot; subfolder.&#10;&#10;An information about every signal will be extracted from an appropriate&#10;binary *.par file  in correspondence with a chosen binary *.dat file&#10;(or from the beginning of a chosen *.dat file in case of SATURN SDI-AD12-128H)&#10;This information will be shown in the right part of the program's main window,&#10;according to a selected  table row.&#10;&#10;In addition it is possible to open data presented in a text file.&#10;For now it should be a single file per signal - with a single data column inside.&#10;You will be prompted to enter some data manually in this case (date, channel number, ADC rate...).&#10;   &#10;&#10;How to use:&#10;&#10;   - &quot;File-&gt;Open&quot;                             shows a file chooser dialog, files with &quot;dat&quot; and &quot;txt&quot;&#10;                                                       extensions will be available;&#10;   - &quot;File-&gt;Open Auto&quot;                     shows a directory chooser dialog to set a directory&#10;                                                       for watching new files creation by an ADC, by copying, etc.&#10;&#10;   - &quot;Plot-&gt;Export all to txt &quot;            converts all signals shown in the main table&#10;                                                       to the text format and save it to a subfolder named &quot;&lt;source&gt;/txt&quot;&#10;   - &quot;Plot-&gt;Draw&quot;                             shows selected signals;&#10;                                                       arrow UP,DOWN - list by one; ctrl+HOME - show all in one;&#10;   - &quot;Plot-&gt;Draw by one&quot;                 shows selected signals inside one plot as a stack, one by one;&#10;   - &quot;Plot-&gt;Draw by one and scroll&quot; shows selected signals one by one inside a scrolling pane;&#10;&#10;   - When plots are shown, Savitsky-Golay filter can be applied.&#10;   - double click on table will check/uncheck all signals&#10;   - individual color can be set for every signal&#10;   - hot keys for menu items;&#10;   - key &quot;f&quot; when pressed will move panel divider position to show/hide signals lists&#10;&#10;Zoom and pan plots with mouse:&#10;&#10;   - zoom: left click + drag from a top left to a bottom right&#10;   - pan: right click + drag &#10;   - rescale to a full view: left click + drag back from a bottom right to a top left&#10;&#10;NOTE: if there are a lot of points, complete drawing will take some time.&#10;      Laptop with Intel i5 renders a 1 000 000 of points about 1 minute,&#10;      in case of drawing all data &quot;as is&quot;.&#10;      Feature is included that enables  rapid drawing even when there are&#10;      millions of data points. Just use zoom to view all the details.&#10;      Canvas drawing now successfully copes with millions of data points&#10;      due to simple &quot;point-per-pixel&quot; approach.&#10;&#10;LICENSING&#10;&#10;Copyright (c) 2016 onward, Aleksey Beletskii  &lt;beletskiial@gmail.com&gt;&#10;All rights reserved&#10;&#10;github: https://github.com/alekseybeletskii&#10;&#10;The ADCDataViewer software serves for visualization and simple processing&#10;of any data recorded with Analog Digital Converters in binary or text form.&#10;&#10;Commercial support is available.
